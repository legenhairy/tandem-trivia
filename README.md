# Tandem Coding Challenge

Goal was to create an application that displays trivia questions with multiple choice answers to choose from. 

## How to Run the Code/ Install Instructions

Note this project was built on a Mac with the Terminal application. This project was set up with the Create React App boilerplate.(https://create-react-app.dev/)

1. Open a new Terminal window and clone the repository onto your computer with the below command(git clone).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legenhairy/tandem-trivia.git
```

2. Then, jump into the project folder by running the below cd command.

```bash
cd tandem-trivia
```
3. Then, install all the dependencies and node modules.

```bash
npm install
```
4. Finally, run the React project by running npm start.

```bash
npm start
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A user can view questions.
- [x] Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.

2. User can share their score to social media networks(like Twitter or Facebook). 
3. Add a live score update so the user can see their score as they play a round of trivia.
